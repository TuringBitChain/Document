# Further notice to all participants of MVC chain (microvisionchain/SPACE)

MVC's distribution team is dishonest and untrustworthy, and they have been preventing people from knowing the true distribution history and illegal behavior of the chain.

As the patent and code owner of the core technology used in the MVC chain, we strongly oppose the illegal actions of the MVC's distribution team and ask anyone not to participate in their illegal ecological activities, and any related cooperation is also illegal.

Our technology has been authorized by patents and declared PCT international patents, and we will defend the rights and interests of our technical achievements globally in the future. We will continue to develop more key technologies, and the related technologies are expected to become core technologies that will be supported and protected by the state as a priority.

We hope that all MVC's participants will understand the fraud and concealment of the MVC's distribution team, protect your property and reputation, and resist their illegal acts together with us.
