# A short statement to MicroVisionChain participants: 

The MVC chain published by microvisionchain.com has undergone several changes in the release scheme, and several Chinese people were eventually responsible for it. It has some serious origin problemsï¼š

1) it deviated from the original POW scheme and the second scheme of POW & tax extraction, and insisted on adopting the scheme of reserving 13.6 million coins (65% of the total supply) for issuance in Block #1, which has a great compliance risk (from SEC etc.) and the tendency to extract as much retail funds as possible & as early as possible;
3) its underlying PCT patented MetaTXID technology (the key of the Layer1 UTXO Token of MicroVisionChain) is not authorized for use (a chinese company that has been authorized has also lost its technology license due to contract breach);
4) the MetaTXID part of the code of the MicroVisionChain node-software and the cpuminer compatible support part of the code were copied from github/Turingbitchain project, and the current distribution (MicroVisionChain) was not authorized to use the codes.

As a result, the MicroVisionChain has become a project that cannot be developed under a legal framework and is unlikely to be popularized as a role model for public chains, but rather a microvision project released by several individuals with the primary need for short-term profit based on technical inventions of others, and therefore will likely lead to scamming of enthusiastic participants. In order to avoid the loss of data, money, time, and moral damage to well-intended and uninformed participants, we would like to briefly state our opposition position and the reasons for it.
