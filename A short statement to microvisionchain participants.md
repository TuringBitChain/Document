# A short statement to microvisionchain participants: 

The MVC chain published by microvisionchain.com has undergone several changes in the publishing scheme, and several Chinese people were eventually responsible for it, and has serious origin problemsï¼š

1) it deviated from the original POW scheme and the second scheme of POW & tax extraction, and insisted on adopting the scheme of reserving 13.6 million coins (65% of the total supply) for issuance in Block #1, which has a great compliance risk (from SEC etc.) and the tendency to extract as much retail funds as possible & as early as possible;
2) its underlying PCT patented MetaTXID technology is not authorized for use (a chinese company that has been authorized has also lost its technology license due to contract breach);
3) the MetaTXID part of the code of the microvisionchain node-software and the cpuminer compatible support part of the code were copied from github/Turingbitchain project, and the current distribution (microvisionchain) not authorized to use the codes.

As a result, the microvisionchain has become a project that cannot be developed under a legal framework and is basically unlikely to be popularized as a future role model for public chains, but rather a microvision project released by several individuals with the primary need for short-term profit, and therefore will likely lead to scamming of enthusiastic participants. In order to avoid the loss of data, money, time, and moral damage to well-intended and uninformed participants, we would like to briefly state our opposition position and the reasons for it.
