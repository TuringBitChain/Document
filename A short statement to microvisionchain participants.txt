A short statement to microvisionchain participants: 
The MVC chain released by microvisionchain.com has undergone several changes in the release scheme, 1) deviated from the original POW scheme and the scheme of POW & tax extraction, and insisted on adopting the scheme of reserving 13.6 million Tokens for issuance, which has a great compliance risk and the tendency to do as much as possible as early as possible. 2) its underlying patented MetaTXID technology is not authorized for use (including a company that has been authorized has also lost its technology license due to contract breach), 3) the MetaTXID part of the code of the chain node software and the cpuminer GBT api compatible support part of the code was copied on github/ Turingbitchain project, but the current distribution does not have legal rights to use the code.
As a result, the chain has become a project that cannot be developed under a compliant legal framework and is basically unlikely to be popularized as a future role model for public chains, but rather a microvision project released by several individuals with the primary need for short-term profit, and therefore will likely lead to scamming of enthusiastic participants. In order to avoid the loss of data, money, time, or moral damage to good and uninformed participants, we would like to briefly state our opposition position and the reasons for it.
