# History of MicroVisionChain

On 7/2/21: Sunny (owner of Show3), who is currently the biggest leader in the MVC chain and the controllers of the MVC website, said **"Your TBC[1] has a lot of opportunity and imagination"**. Since then, he had continued to persuade me not to fork an old chain, but to make a new chain.

On 2/4/22: NIGO (partner of Jason) contacted me for an offline meeting to seriously discuss a new blockchain based on our new MetaTXID technology[2], either a fork or a new chain. Since then, the MVC project has been launched after NIGO hired a good node developer, and the initial MVC stands for MetaverseChain.

On 3/3/22: Sunny and NIGO (partner of Jason) visited me offline, and repeatedly assured me that they would follow my design and make a pure POW chain that is completely legal and compliant, which is my core requirement. **I personally expressed my trust in them and asked that the chain not be pre-mineable, which they were both in favor of.**

Before 6/17/22: Key development of the node software was completed (dev of Token script is independent of node development), the code for MetaTXID/cpuminer[3] in the TuringBitChain project was migrated and verified on MVC, and the new contract transactions including non-standard scripts were successfully uploaded to the chain. **During this process, Heshuchao, the NIGO paid node software developer, surprisingly said that it hadn't done any development in C++**, and he was delayed in building the first block correctly until I pointed out his mistake in transaction codecs. They have been deceiving MVC followers on the development experience of the node team. The products on MVC are actually migrated from their products on BSV, and most members of the MVC dev team are essentially WEB front-end/back-end developers. Until now, there were no developers skilled in C++ on the entire MVC distribution team.

**So, most likely, once they've sold most of the security tokens they've retained at BLOCK#1, they'll seek some developers to take over the blockchain through little SPACE token incentive, and then, leaving subsequent developers with a great deal of risk.**

On 7/6/22: Sunny talked with me about the difficulties of funding, promotion, and expressed their desire to keep some of the coins for early developers and later ecological rewards. After difficult consideration, for retaining a pure POW offering, I personally proposed a compromise of taking a cut of the rewards earned by the producers (miners) of each block. **In my design, the extracted Coinbase rewards could perhaps be used to pay royalties for participants across the blockchain, which could drive a new and progressive form of technology licensing.** This scheme is known as "Pumping", with reference to the birth of the eCash blockchain[4].

From 7/25/22: Sunny said he wanted to raise money through MVC and repeated that investors want to reserve/control a portion of the coins from the start of the chain. Since then, Sunny keeps explaining to me that the "Reservation" scheme is better than the "Pumping" scheme. I insisted that the "Pumping" scheme was enough for the developers involved to get some reward incentive, and enough for the investors to get a long term incentive, and there was also a greater desire to address the licensing of proprietary technology across the blockchain. They never convinced me, and I couldn't convince them, but NIGO said they could accept my "Pumping" scheme (with Coinbase incentives).

On 8/1/22: Sunny, and other major participants, Sunny started to authorize Heshuchao to develop based on the "Reservation" scheme to force a certain amount of coins **to be issued in the first block and to avoid reorganization by miners.** I warned about the risk of this being an offering of securities, but no one cares.

On 8/6/22: Sunny said "changed to Reservation at first, this facilitates financing". I was feeling a bit overwhelmed after they changed the release program of node software several times, while at the same time thinking that this new scheme was probably also a temporary solution, and that when they failed to raise funds, they would reaccept my proposal.

After 8/22/22: They set up a DAO group for the MVC program, and also started a voting mechanism, and my opinion represented only one of the crowd. I didn't understand the change in my situation at the time, but also recognized that they no longer had to have my tech support and couldn't vote on an option that I actually approved of.

**Between August and December 2022, I also had a lot of work that required me to work overtime, so I had little time to due with MVC-related disputes.**

On 9/7/2022, 10/4/2022, 11/10/2022 and 1/14/2023: I have repeatedly asked them to stop using and remove false content related to the MetaTXID technology in MVC' website and technical white papers[5]. I also told them the MVC Chain is not licensed under the MetaTXID patent[6]. But, Sunny, the controllers of the MVC website, has always behaved in a dilatory and perfunctory manner. **At this stage, I've already declared the exit from MVC project to Sunny.**

**Finally, during the discussion meeting on the night of January 6, 2023**, they kicked out NIGO, the only remaining supporter of mine, and there was no one who spoke for NIGO except me. I learned that they have left no possibility for me to return to legal compliance. So I immediately sent them final notices that I firmly disagree with the release with pre-mined a large number of coins, and that once the MVC blockchain with reserved tokens is released, **I will no longer work to promote MVC compliance and legality, and I will go through legal actions to make sure that this illegal blockchain doesn't survive for a long time. However they still illegally, fraudulently, and immorally issued the MVC blockchain on 1/26/2023 with pre-mined 13650000 SPACE at BLOCK#1.**

**As MVC falls and disappears, I do hope that uninformed and defrauded followers of MVC will avoid the loss of time, money, reputation, and Stockholm Syndrome[7]. So, I've made two statements[8] and posted those in the MVC user group, but the posts are promptly removed by the MVC team. They are firstly afraid to face their dishonorable history, and then when they have to, they inevitably attack me. Thankfully, before they issued the illegal blockchain, I thoroughly saw their character and made a clean break with the illegal project. I don't have time to do more for now, but some statements are necessary to try to prevent good people from being deceived.**	

**Whether or not you see this materials, and whether or not you believe this statement, is up to God.**
